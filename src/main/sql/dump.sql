The phrase refers to the lag-time between dispatch of a letter and its receipt, versus the virtually instantaneous dispatch and delivery of its electronic equivalent, email.\r\n\r\nIt is also known, more neutrally, as paper mail, postal mail, land mail, or simply mail and post. An earlier term of the same type is surface mail, coined retrospectively after the development of airmail. This happened between the 1970s and 1990s.[1]\r\n\r\nSnail mail penfriends or penpals are those that communicate with one another through the postal system, rather than on the Internet which has become the more common medium.\r\n\r\nSome online groups also use paper mail through regular gift or craft hot topics. In some countries, services are available to print and deliver emails to those unable to receive email, like people with no computers or Internet access.\r\n\r\nSimilar terminology was used in the 1840s to contrast the already-operating postal mail with the new telegraph.

The particular class of objects and type of transformations are usually indicated by the context in which the term is used. For example, the area of a triangle is an invariant with respect to isometries of the Euclidean plane. The phrases \"invariant under\" and \"invariant to\" a transformation are both used. More generally, an invariant with respect to an equivalence relation is a property that is constant on each equivalence class.\r\n\r\nInvariants are used in diverse areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology and algebra. Some important classes of transformations are defined by an invariant they leave unchanged, for example conformal maps are defined as transformations of the plane that preserve angles. The discovery of invariants is an important step in the process of classifying mathematical objects.'),(6,'Coefficient','Коэффициент','Коефіцієнт','koʊ.ɪˈfɪʃ.ənt','2018-04-07 04:24:30','In mathematics, a coefficient is a multiplicative factor in some term of a polynomial, a series or any expression; it is usually a number, but may be any expression. In the latter case, the variables appearing in the coefficients are often called parameters, and must be clearly distinguished from the other variables.\r\n\r\nFor example, in\r\n\r\n{\\displaystyle 7x^{2}-3xy+1.5+y,} {\\displaystyle 7x^{2}-3xy+1.5+y,}\r\nthe first two terms respectively have the coefficients 7 and −3. The third term 1.5 is a constant. The final term does not have any explicitly written coefficient, but is considered to have coefficient 1, since multiplying by that factor would not change the term.\r\n\r\nOften coefficients are numbers as in this example, although they could be parameters of the problem or any expression in these parameters. In such a case one must clearly distinguish between symbols representing variables and symbols representing parameters. Following Descartes, the variables are often denoted by x, y, ..., and the parameters by a, b, c, ..., but it is not always the case. For example, if y is considered as a parameter in the above expression, the coefficient of x is −3y, and the constant coefficient is 1.5 + y.\r\n\r\nWhen one writes\r\n\r\n{\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c} ax^{2}+bx+c,\r\nit is generally supposed that x is the only variable and that a, b and c are parameters; thus the constant coefficient is c in this case.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, any polynomial in one variable x can be written as\r\n\r\n{\\displaystyle a_{k}x^{k}+\\dotsb +a_{1}x^{1}+a_{0}} a_{k}x^{k}+\\dotsb +a_{1}x^{1}+a_{0}\r\nfor some positive integer {\\displaystyle k} k, where {\\displaystyle a_{k},\\dotsc ,a_{1},a_{0}} a_{k},\\dotsc ,a_{1},a_{0} are coefficients; to allow this kind of expression in all cases one must allow introducing terms with 0 as coefficient. For the largest {\\displaystyle i} i with {\\displaystyle a_{i}\\neq 0} a_{i}\\neq 0 (if any), {\\displaystyle a_{i}} a_{i} is called the leading coefficient of the polynomial. So for example the leading coefficient of the polynomial'),(7,'Variable ','Переме́нная ','Змінна','ˈveə.ri.ə.bəl','2018-04-07 04:26:56','In elementary mathematics, a variable is a symbol, commonly an alphabetic character, that represents a number, called the value of the variable, which is either arbitrary, not fully specified, or unknown. Making algebraic computations with variables as if they were explicit numbers allows one to solve a range of problems in a single computation. A typical example is the quadratic formula, which allows one to solve every quadratic equation by simply substituting the numeric values of the coefficients of the given equation to the variables that represent them.\r\n\r\nThe concept of a variable is also fundamental in calculus. Typically, a function y = f(x) involves two variables, y and x, representing respectively the value and the argument of the function. The term \"variable\" comes from the fact that, when the argument (also called the \"variable of the function\") varies, then the value varies accordingly.[1]\r\n\r\nIn more advanced mathematics, a variable is a symbol that denotes a mathematical object, which could be a number, a vector, a matrix, or even a function. In this case, the original property of \"variability\" of a variable is not kept (except, sometimes, for informal explanations).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in computer science, a variable is a name (commonly an alphabetic character or a word) representing some value represented in computer memory. In mathematical logic, a variable is either a symbol representing an unspecified term of the theory, or a basic object of the theory, which is manipulated without referring to its possible intuitive interpretation.'),(8,'Constructive proof','Конструктивное доказательство','Конструктивне доведення','kənˈstrʌk.tɪv pruːf','2018-04-07 04:30:01','In mathematics, a constructive proof is a method of proof that demonstrates the existence of a mathematical object by creating or providing a method for creating the object. This is in contrast to a non-constructive proof (also known as an existence proof or pure existence theorem) which proves the existence of a particular kind of object without providing an example.\r\n\r\nSome non-constructive proofs show that if a certain proposition is false, a contradiction ensues; consequently the proposition must be true (proof by contradiction). However, the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet) has been accepted in some varieties of constructive mathematics, including intuitionism.\r\n\r\nConstructivism is a mathematical philosophy that rejects all but constructive proofs in mathematics. This leads to a restriction on the proof methods allowed (prototypically, the law of the excluded middle is not accepted) and a different meaning of terminology (for example, the term \"or\" has a stronger meaning in constructive mathematics than in classical).\r\n\r\nConstructive proofs can be seen as defining certified mathematical algorithms: this idea is explored in the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation of constructive logic, the Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, and such logical systems as Per Martin-Löf\'s Intuitionistic Type Theory, and Thierry Coquand and Gérard Huet\'s Calculus of Constructions.'),(9,'Theorem','Теорема','Теорема','ˈθiː.rəm','2018-04-07 04:31:47','In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally deductive, in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental.[2]\r\n\r\nMany mathematical theorems are conditional statements. In this case, the proof deduces the conclusion from conditions called hypotheses or premises. In light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth, the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary consequence of the hypotheses, namely, that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true, without any further assumptions. However, the conditional could be interpreted differently in certain deductive systems, depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol.\r\n\r\nAlthough they can be written in a completely symbolic form, for example, within the propositional calculus, theorems are often expressed in a natural language such as English. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed. Such arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones—indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way why it is obviously true. In some cases, a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theorem. Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its aesthetics. Theorems are often described as being \"trivial\", or \"difficult\", or \"deep\", or even \"beautiful\". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time: for example, as a proof is simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. Fermat\'s Last Theorem is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.'),(10,'Terrain','Рельеф','Рельєф','təˈreɪn','2018-04-07 04:35:20','Present-day Earth altimetry and bathymetry.

В каботажном плавании почти всё время находились корабли античных мореходов — сначала египтян, затем греков и римлян, а позднее и викингов.\r\n\r\nТак как в настоящее время почти во всех странах каботаж является исключительным правом торгового флота этих стран, то «мореходный» каботаж стал равен «юридическому». То есть, нередко употребляющие термин «каботажное плавание» подразумевают под ним «плавание без выхода за границы страны».\r\n\r\nРазличают большой каботаж (перевозку грузов и пассажиров между портами разных морей) и малый каботаж (перевозки между портами одного и того же моря).\r\n\r\nВ бывшем СССР в отношении к каботажу рассматривались как одно море:\r\n\r\nЧёрное и Азовское моря\r\nБелое море и Северный Ледовитый океан\r\nЯпонское, Охотское и Берингово моря\r\nКак правило, каботаж осуществляется каботажным флотом — судами, предназначенными для совершения плавания в ограниченном районе, обычно на небольшом удалении от берега и портов-убежищ.\r\n\r\nСамым крупным в мире каботажным флотом обладает Греция.'),(26,'Forecastle','Бак (морской термин)','Бак (морський термін)','ˈfɔːr.kæs.tɚ','2018-04-07 05:53:23','Бак (нидерл. bak) — передняя часть палубы (от носа до фок-мачты) или палубы носовой надстройки[1][2].\r\n\r\nНадстройку над верхней палубой в носовой части корабля называется полубак[1]. Удлинённый полубак может занимать до 2/3 длины судна[3].\r\n\r\nОсновное назначение полубака заключается в увеличении высоты борта в носовой части корабля, что важно для обеспечения хорошей мореходности, защиты верхней палубы от заливания при встречной волне и повышения непотопляемости. В удлинённом баке на грузовых судах располагают грузовые твиндеки, на пассажирских судах — каюты.\r\n\r\nНа баке или внутри полубака обычно располагают якорное и швартовное устройства.'),(27,'Sail','Парус','Вітрило','seɪl','2018-04-07 05:55:27','A sail is a tensile structure—made from fabric or other membrane materials—that uses wind power to propel sailing craft, including sailing ships, sailboats, windsurfers, ice boats, and even sail-powered land vehicles. Sails may be made from a combination of woven materials—including canvas or polyester cloth, laminated membranes or bonded filaments—usually in a three- or four-sided shape.\r\n\r\nA sail provides propulsive force via a combination of lift and drag, depending on its angle of attack—its angle with respect to the apparent wind. Apparent wind is the air velocity experienced on the moving craft and is the combined effect of the true wind velocity with the velocity of the sailing craft. Angle of attack is often constrained by the sailing craft\'s orientation to the wind or point of sail. On points of sail where it is possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind, the sail may act as an airfoil, generating propulsive force as air passes along its surface—just as an airplane wing generates lift—which predominates over aerodynamic drag retarding forward motion. The more that the angle of attack diverges from the apparent wind as a sailing craft turns downwind, the more drag increases and lift decreases as propulsive forces, until a sail going downwind is predominated by drag forces. Sails are unable to generate propulsive force if they are aligned too closely to the wind.\r\n\r\nSails may be attached to a mast, boom or other spar or may be attached to a wire that is suspended by a mast. They are typically raised by a line, called a halyard, and their angle with respect to the wind is usually controlled by a line, called a sheet. In use, they may be designed to be curved in both directions along their surface, often as a result of their curved edges. battens may be used to extend the trailing edge of a sail beyond the line of its attachment points.\r\n\r\nOther non-rotating airfoils that power sailing craft include wingsails, which are rigid wing-like structures, and kites that power kite-rigged vessels, but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article.'),(28,'Aval','Аваль ','Аваль','əˈvæl','2018-04-07 05:58:56','Аваль (фр. aval, предположительно от араб. حوالة‎) — поручительство по векселю или чеку; допускается для любого лица, кроме плательщика. Авалист ответствен наравне с векселедателем, причём его обязательство действительно даже в том случае, если то обязательство, которое он гарантировал, окажется недействительным по какому бы то ни было основанию, иному, чем дефект формы. В этом отношении аваль совершенно равен не поручительству, которое носит дополнительный (акцессо́рный) характер по отношению к основному обязательству, а банковской гарантии.\r\n\r\nАваль осуществляется путём надписи на векселе или чеке; он приписывает своё имя к имени плательщика, прибавляя к этому слова «per aval» (или «считать за аваль» или любую равнозначную формулу) и проставлением подписи тем, кто даёт аваль. Однако для действительности аваля достаточно и одной только подписи авалиста на лицевой стороне векселя или чека, если только эта подпись не поставлена плательщиком или векселедателем.\r\n\r\nВ авале должно быть указано, за кого он дан. При отсутствии такого указания он считается данным за векселедателя или чекодателя.\r\n\r\nОплачивая вексель или чек, авалист приобретает права, вытекающие из векселя или чека, в отношении к тому, за кого он дал гарантию, и в отношении также и тех, которые в силу векселя или чека обязаны перед этим последним.\r\n\r\nАваль может размещаться на оборотной стороне векселя или на аллонже.'),(29,'Benchmarking','Бенчмаркинг','Бенчмаркінг','ˈbentʃ.mɑːrk','2018-04-07 06:00:40','Benchmarking is comparing one\'s business processes and performance metrics to industry bests and best practices from other companies. In project management benchmarking can also support the selection, planning and delivery of projects.[1] Dimensions typically measured are quality, time and cost. In the process of best practice benchmarking, management identifies the best firms in their industry, or in another industry where similar processes exist, and compares the results and processes of those studied (the \"targets\") to one\'s own results and processes. In this way, they learn how well the targets perform and, more importantly, the business processes that explain why these firms are successful. According to National Council on Measurement in Education, benchmark assessments [2] are short assessments used by teachers at various times throughout the school year to monitor student progress in some area of the school curriculum. These also are known as interim assessments.\r\n\r\nBenchmarking is used to measure performance using a specific indicator (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others.[3]\r\n\r\nAlso referred to as \"best practice benchmarking\" or \"process benchmarking\", this process is used in management which particularly shows VEMR strategic management, in which organizations evaluate various aspects of their processes in relation to best practice companies\' processes, usually within a peer group defined for the purposes of comparison. This then allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or adapt specific best practices, usually with the aim of increasing some aspect of performance. Benchmarking may be a one-off event, but is often treated as a continuous process in which organizations continually seek to improve their practices.'),(30,'Deficit','Дефицит','Дефіцит','ˈdef.ə.sɪt','2018-04-07 06:02:54','A deficit is the amount by which a sum falls short of some reference amount.\r\n\r\nIn economics, a deficit is an excess of expenditures over revenue in a given time period; in more specific cases it may refer to:\r\n\r\nBalance of payments deficit, when the balance of payments is negative\r\nGovernment budget deficit\r\nDeficit spending\r\nPrimary deficit, the pure deficit derived after deducting the interest payments\r\nStructural and cyclical deficit, parts of the public sector deficit\r\nIncome deficit, the difference between family income and the poverty threshold\r\nTrade deficit, when the value of imports exceed the value of exports');
